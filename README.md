### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built an app that allows functionality to save, delete, and otherwise store ideas on individual cards. The user can only save an idea when both Title and Body text have been entered. As cards are created, they are arrayed in the bottom portion of the screen.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Click the green <> Code button. Confirm SSH is selected. Click the Copy Code button at the end of the link (the icon looks like a box on top of a box). 
2. Go into your terminal. After confirming you are in the right location, type "git clone [insert link copied from previous step]". Hit Return/Enter.
3. CD into the cloned file. Type "code ." to open up files in your code viewer (i.e., VS Code).
4. Enter "open index.html" into your terminal in order to open the website. This is where you will see your local changes.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had around 6.5 days to work on the project, and we have just today started Week 5.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Some of the goals were learning to work in a group, event delegation, and full use of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We worked quite well as a team, employing Driver-Navigator, Pairing, and Divide and Conquer to make our way through the material. We were able to make it all the way through to deleting cards (which, itself, was quite tricky). There were periods where we were unsure how to proceed as a group, but we talked it out and were able to make our way forward. As is to be expected, making sure that all members' files were up-to-date was quite tricky; we defaulted to copy-paste a bit, but otherwise leveraged GitHub.
